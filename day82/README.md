# Day 82 - Professional Portfolio Project - Python Web Development
## Assignment: Portfolio Website
A website to show off your skills and the things you've built.
## Assignment instructions
Using what you have learnt about web development, build your own portfolio website.

This can be designed any way you want. It's the place to show off your skills and the things you've built.

[Take inspiration from other developers](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/15-web-developer-portfolios-to-inspire-you-137fb1743cae/) but try not to copy their designs. Because this is about showing off what you can do!

Use what you've learnt from Day 65 and plan out your website. Think about design, UI, UX, colour schemes, fonts. Don't build the website for other people, build it to make yourself proud.

If you want, deploy and host the website to share with other students so we can admire your hard work!

### Notes:
After giving it some thought, I've realized that I don't want to create a portfolio page with personal information just yet, and filling out another template with Lorem ipsum seemed, well... a little silly.

Instead, in accordance with the spirit of the course, I've decided to go with something real, something that I could use right now. That is, customize a simple template to create a temporary "Coming Soon" landing page for my actual personal website.
